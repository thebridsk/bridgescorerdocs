The BridgeScorekeeper allows you to keep score for [Duplicate Bridge](duplicate.html), [Chicago Bridge](chicago.html), and [Rubber Bridge](rubber.html).

It all starts at the [Home page](home.html).  From any page of the BridgeScoreKeeper, to get to the home page, click or touch the house, left side of the application bar, blue bar, at the top.

On every page on the right in the application bar is a circle with a question mark in it.  Clicking or touching this will open up the help pages.  If there is a help page for the current page, then the help for that page is displayed, otherwise the main help page is displayed.

The three horizontal lines in the top left of the page in the application bar is the main menu button.  Not all pages have this button.  The menu will have items that are relevant to the displayed page.

The three vertial dots at the right are additional help information for developers.
