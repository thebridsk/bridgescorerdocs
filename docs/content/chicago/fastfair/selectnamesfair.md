This shows the five person Chicago match with fair rotation.  The **Prior hand** section shows the player positions in the hand that was just played.  The **Sitting out** section is where the next player to sit out is selected.  Once a player is selected, the **Next hand** section is displayed.  This shows where the players are positioned for the next hand.  The next dealer is also identified.

The players highlighted in green must switch, and the players highlighted in cyan must switch.  Once the players have switched, hit the **OK** button.

The **Reset** button is used to clear the sitting out player selection.

The **Cancel** button is used to leave this page.
