This page shows the summary of the match.

In the first table, the rows are the rounds.  The second table normally shows the last round played.

In the first table, hitting the buttons in the **Round** column will cause that round to be displayed as the second table.

In the second table, the buttons in the **Hand** column will show the [Entering a Hand](hand.html) page for that hand.  Modifications can be made to the entering a hand page at this point and if **OK** is hit the changes are used.  If **Cancel** is hit, then the changes are discard and the original information is used. 

The **Next Hand** button is only shown if another hand can be played in the round.  When hit, the [Entering a Hand](hand.html) page is shown to enter the next hand.

The **Quit** button ends the match and returns you to the [Chicago List](list.html) page.

The **All Rounds** button will show all rounds played on the page.
