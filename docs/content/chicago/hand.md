The contract is entered at the top, the number of tricks, the suit or no trump, the double status and the declarer.  The declarer diamond always has the scorekeeper on the bottom.  If the scorekeeper is entering the data, then the remaining names are in the same position on the page as players at the table.

Once the contract has been entered, then the **Made** and **Down** buttons appear, once one of them is clicked, then the trick number buttons appear.  For made contracts the numbers refer to the number of tricks above 6.  For down contracts the numbers refer to the number of tricks the contract is down.

Verify the score at the bottom right, above the **OK** button.  At the bottom right, above the **Clear** button, there is a breakdown of how the score was calculated.

When the contract and result is correct, hit the **OK** button.

The **Clear** button is to remove all the contract and result selections.

The **Cancel** button will not save any results, and return to the [summary page](summary.html).

The scorekeeper can be changed in the middle of the round by hitting the **Change Scorekeeper** button.

If a declarer button has a red square with the word *Vul* in it, then that players team is vulnerable for that hand.  Not vulnerable is shown with a gray square with the word ~~vul~~.
