This page shows the results of the Rubber Bridge match.

In the first table gives a simplified view of the results.  Typically it is the same as it would be on paper.

The second table show details about each hand.  The last two columns are the two teams.  Number prefixed with an `H` are honor points, numbers in parentheses are score above the line.  Numbers without any adornments are scores below the line.

The **Next Hand** buttons start the next hand, and display the [Enter Hand page](hand.html).  The button is only displayed if the Rubber match is not completed.
