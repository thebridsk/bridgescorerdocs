# Scoring Duplicate Matches

Start by hitting, on the [home page](../home/), the **List Duplicate** button, which shows the [summary page](summary/), or **New Duplicate** buttons, which shows the [new duplicate page](new/).

On many of the duplicate pages, there may be two buttons at the bottom of the page.

- **Enable Beeps** - enable beeps when a round is completed on all tables.
- **Disable Beeps** - disable the beeps.
