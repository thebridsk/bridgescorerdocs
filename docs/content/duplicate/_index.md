# Scoring Duplicate Matches

Start by hitting, on the [home page](home.html), the **List Duplicate** button, which shows the [summary page](duplicate/summary.html), or **New Duplicate** buttons, which shows the [new duplicate page](duplicate/new.html).

On many of the duplicate pages, there may be two buttons at the bottom of the page.

- **Enable Beeps** - enable beeps when a round is completed on all tables.
- **Disable Beeps** - disable the beeps.
