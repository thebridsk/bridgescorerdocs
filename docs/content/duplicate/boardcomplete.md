board buttons indicate that no one has played the board.

If all teams have played the board, then the contracts and results are shown.  Example: Board 5.

A contract of *played* and checkmarks, &#x2713;, indicate that the team has played the board but the result can't be shown since all teams haven't played the board.  Example: Board 8.

The **Scoreboard** button returns to the [scoreboard page](scoreboardcomplete.html)

The **All Boards** button shows all the boards on one page.  The table in the above figures would be repeated for every board in the match.

The **Match Points** button, which can also be **Played Scoring Method** or **International Match Points** identifies how the scores are displayed in the board page.  This will not change the scoring method of the match, only show what the score would be with an alternate scoring method.
