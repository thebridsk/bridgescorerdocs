The scorekeeper is at the bottom, the partner of the scorekeeper is at the top.  The players to the left and right of the scorekeeper are listed.  The players may need to be swapped by hitting one of the **Swap &#x21c4;** or **Swap &#x21c6;** buttons.

Hit **OK** when all the players are correct.  This will either show the [scoreboard page for table](../scoreboardfromtable/) if the round button was hit or the [enter hand page](../enterhand/) if a board was hit.
