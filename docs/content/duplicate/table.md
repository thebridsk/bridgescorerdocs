The table shows the round, the north-south team, the east-west team, and the boards that should be played in the rounds.

Once the player names have been entered in the first round, the player names, in addition to the team number, will show in the **NS** and **EW** columns.

If none of the boards in the round have been played at this table, then hitting any of the light yellow

buttons will then show the [enter scorekeeper page](enterscorekeepername.html) on the first round, and [select scorekeeper page](selectscorekeepername.html) in later rounds.

Rounds higher than the current round are grayed out.

The **Input Style** button shows what the current input style is for entering the results of a hand.  The values are:

- **Yellow** all items that need to be entered are yellow.  The dark yellow can be used to enter the information in a convenient order.  
- **Prompt** will only show one item in yellow at a time.  Selecting one of the values will cause another set of items to appear in yellow.
- **Original** is the original style of entering information.
