From this page, new Duplicate matches can be started.

![NewDuplicate](../images/gen/Duplicate/NewDuplicate.png)

The page give a choice of movements to use and the board set to use.  Just click the button in the table to start the match.  This will then display the [scoreboard page](scoreboardcomplete.html) of the new match.

The **Create Results Only**, when checked, is used for entering a match result from a match that was not scored with the BridgeScoreKeeper.  Only the team players and total points each earned are entered.  This is useful because the team players are used by the pairs suggestion.

When unchecked, a duplicate match is created ready for keeping score of the match.
