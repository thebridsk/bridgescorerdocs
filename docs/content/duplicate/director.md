The director pages does not hide any information.  These pages are used by the director to look at disputes and to fix scores that were improperly entered.

The director pages include the scoreboard page, board page, and hand page.

To director pages, click the main menu button, three horizontal bars in left of blue app bar, then select `Director's Scoreboard`.  This brings up the director's scoreboard, from there you can navigate to the other pages.

For help on the director pages, go to the help on the corresponding regular page.

From the **Director's Scoreboard** page the scoring method, IMP or MP, can be changed.  The scoring method should only be changed at the start of the match.  The reason is that the scoring method that is used will affect the tactics used by the players.  For example: in IMP scoring a single overtrick is not worth much in IMP, while a failed contract vs a made contract is worth a lot.  While in MP scoring they are worth the same.
