![FinalScoreboard](../images/gen/Duplicate/FinalScoreboard.png)

Once the duplicate match has been finished, all hands played, a **Details** button appears.  This shows a table on the page showing how many times a team was declarer or defender and for each how many times the contract was made or went down.

See the help for the [scoreboard page](scoreboardcomplete.html) of a complete description of the other tables that are shown on the page.
